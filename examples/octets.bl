;; C (oCtet) is a simple grouping of 8 bits

;; C-literals start with 0x and are zero padded to 2
0x00 say

;; Cs can be converted into Rs
;; it will represent the first 8 bytes of unicode including 7-bit ASCII
;; often you'll want to use the R-literal ASCII syntax for that instead
0x27 c-to-r say

;; when doing IO, you'll get Cs when reading
;; Vs or Cs can be composed into Ts to get Rs
;; to demonstrate this pattern, we'll create a Q with some Cs
q-new 0xE4 enq 0xB8 enq 0x96 enq

;; create an empty T to append to
''

swap deq rot swap app
swap deq rot swap app
swap deq rot swap app

;; take the first R from the T and match it against a known R literal
0 ato \ä¸– eq
say
